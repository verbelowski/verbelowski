## 1. Experience
- In 2020, I began my programming journey, with [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) as my first language, which I used for two years. Later, I discovered [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which I fell in love with, making it my primary language ever since. In 2022, I started learning [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/), with which I initially had quite a few difficulties, but the more I delved into it, the more I felt that I was starting to understand it better. Finally, 2024 arrived, and I began experimenting with [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), and at the moment, I am still in the process of learning it
