# Hello, my name is Vertennn! <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=verbelowski" alt="This image shows the profile views." />

I’m a technology enthusiast, and in my free time I enjoy programming and <br />
music, love animals and anime, and like reading, cooking, and doing sports.

## About Me

I design and build whatever I can imagine. <br />
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build and ship it.

My pinned project is my NixOS system configuration using Hyprland as the window manager. <br />
So far, this is my main public repository, but I’m learning and experimenting a lot privately.

More projects, especially open-source, will appear soon as I start programming seriously.

## Statistics

...It'll appear as soon as I prepare them.
