# Hello, my name is Vertennn! <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=verbelowski" alt="This image shows the profile views." />

I’m a technology enthusiast, and in my free time I enjoy programming and <br />
music, love animals and anime, and like reading, cooking, and doing sports.

## About Me

I design and build whatever I can imagine. <br />
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build and ship it.

My pinned projects include "nix-config" and "github-statistics". <br />
I experiment in private repositories and publish them once polished.

More projects, especially open-source, will appear soon as I start programming seriously.

## Statistics

*At the moment, I am working on my own statistics script.*
