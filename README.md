# Hi, I'm Vertennn! <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=verbelowski" alt="This image shows the profile views." />

<em>
  I’m a technology enthusiast, and in my free time I enjoy programming and <br />
  music, love animals and anime, and like reading, cooking, and doing sports.
</em>

## About Me

<em>
  I design and build whatever I can imagine. <br />
  If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build and ship it.
</em>

<br />
<br />

<em>
  At the moment, I don’t have many public repositories, but that will change. <br />
  I implement my ideas in private repositories. If I consider them polished enough, I will release them.
</em>

<br />
<br />

<em>I value open-source, so whenever possible, I aim to make most of my projects available that way.</em>
