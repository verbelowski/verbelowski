# Hi, I am Vertennn! <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=verbelowski" alt="">
- A backend-focused developer from Poland.
- A fast-learning programmer focusing on open-source software.
- A programming enthusiast for over 4 years now.

## 1. Experience
- In 2020, I began my programming journey, with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/) as my first language, which I used for two years. Later, I found [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which I fell in love with, making it my primary language ever since. In 2022, I started learning [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/), with which I initially had quite a few difficulties, but the more I delved into it, the more I felt that I was starting to understand it better. Finally, in 2024, I started working with [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), and at the moment, I am still learning it. In the meantime, I also worked on projects using [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp/), and [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/).
